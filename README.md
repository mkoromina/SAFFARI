### Statistical And Functional Fine-mApping of GWAS Risk locI (SAFFARI) 

**SAFFARI** is designed to implement Snakemake and run 4 different fine-mapping methods (SuSiE, FINEMAP, PolyFun+SuSiE, PolyFun+FINEMAP).
Please read thoroughly the [WiKi page](https://github.com/mkoromina/SAFFARI/wiki) for more details and how to set-up SAFFARI.

**Manuscript** has been submitted for publication in Nature Neuroscience.
